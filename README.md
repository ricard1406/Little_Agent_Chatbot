# Little Agent Chatbot 🤖

A lightweight local AI agent chatbot powered by Ollama, Qwen3, and Langchain with RAG capabilities.

## 🌟 Overview

Little Agent Chatbot is a simple yet powerful local AI assistant that runs entirely on your machine. Built for learning and experimentation, it combines the power of open-source LLMs with advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to create an intelligent chatbot that can work with your personal documents and provide real-time information.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🏠 Fully Local**: Runs completely on your machine - no data leaves your device
- **💰 Budget-Friendly**: Works on low-resource hardware using efficient models (Qwen3 1.7B or 4B)
- **📚 RAG Integration**: Upload and chat with your PDF documents using ChromaDB and Nomic embeddings
- **🌐 Real-Time Data**: Get live weather information and perform calculations
- **🔧 Agent Framework**: Extensible agent system built with Langchain
- **💻 Easy Interface**: Clean web interface powered by Gradio
- **🔓 Open Source**: MIT licensed and fully customizable

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **LLM Backend**: [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) with Qwen3 model (1.7B or 4B variants)
- **Agent Framework**: [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/) ecosystem
- **Vector Database**: [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) for document embeddings
- **Embeddings**: Nomic-embed-text for semantic search
- **Document Processing**: PyPDF, Unstructured, TikToken
- **Web Interface**: [Gradio](https://gradio.app/)
- **Language**: Python
- **License**: MIT

## 🎯 What Makes This Special?

- **Privacy First**: Your conversations and documents stay on your device
- **Cost Effective**: No API costs - runs on your hardware
- **Educational**: Perfect for learning about AI agents and RAG systems
- **Extensible**: Easy to modify and add new capabilities
- **Lightweight**: Designed to work on modest hardware setups

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed on your system

   ```

4. **Install Ollama models**
   ```bash
   # Choose one of these Qwen3 models based on your hardware:
   ollama run qwen3:4b        # For better performance (requires more RAM)
   # OR
   ollama run qwen3:1.7b      # For lower resource usage
   
   # Install embedding model for RAG functionality
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. **Open your browser** and navigate to the provided local URL
