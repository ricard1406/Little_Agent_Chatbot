# Little Agent Chatbot - SQL Database Support ðŸš€

## New Feature Overview

**Little Agent Chatbot** now supports SQL database integration! Your chatbot can now retrieve data from local SQL databases, enabling powerful data-driven conversations and queries. Update SQL database tool available.

### âœ… Tested Database Support
- **MariaDB** - Fully tested and supported
- **Extensible** - Deploy any database with a Python interface

## How It Works

The chatbot uses an intelligent agent approach to interpret natural language queries and convert them into appropriate SQL statements. Here's a practical example:

### Sample Database Structure

```sql
MariaDB [MYSTORE]> desc FRUITS;
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field    | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| ITEM     | varchar(50) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| QUANTITY | int(11)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
2 rows in set (0.001 sec)

MariaDB [MYSTORE]> select * from FRUITS;
+---------+----------+
| ITEM    | QUANTITY |
+---------+----------+
| APPLES  |        2 |
| ORANGE  |        3 |
| APRICOT |        5 |
| GRAPES  |        4 |
| BANANA  |        1 |
+---------+----------+
5 rows in set (0.000 sec)
```

### Natural Language Query Example

**User Prompt:** *"Do we have orange in our warehouse?"*

## LLM Performance Comparison

### ðŸ¦™ LLM: llama3.2:3b

```
Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Invoking: `get_SQL_response` with `{'SQL_statement': 'SELECT ITEM, QUANTITY FROM FRUITS'}`

--- Running Query ---
Connecting to MariaDB...
Connection successful.
Connection closed.

APPLES, 2
ORANGE, 3
APRICOT, 5
GRAPES, 4
BANANA, 1

Response: Based on the response from our warehouse management system, we do have oranges in stock. The quantity of oranges available is 3 units.
```

### ðŸ¤– LLM: qwen3:1.7b

```
Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Invoking: `get_SQL_response` with `{'SQL_statement': "SELECT ITEM, QUANTITY FROM FRUITS WHERE ITEM = 'orange';"}`

--- Running Query ---
Connecting to MariaDB...
Connection successful.
Connection closed.

ORANGE, 3

Response: Yes, we have orange in the warehouse. The quantity available is 3 units.
```

> **Note:** Notice how different LLMs approach the same query - some use broader SELECT statements while others optimize with WHERE clauses.


**One more User Prompt:** *"Please increase by 2 apples quantity in our warehouse"*
```
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Invoking: `put_SQL_insert` with `{'SQL_statement': "UPDATE FRUITS SET QUANTITY = QUANTITY + 2 WHERE ITEM = 'APPLES';"}`
Statement executed successfully.<think>
Okay, let's see. The user said, "Please increase by 2 apples quantity in our warehouse." I need to figure out how to handle this.
First, the user is referring to the warehouse's apple quantity. The available functions include put_SQL_insert, which is for updating SQL tables. The allowed tables are FRUITS and VEGGIE, and the allowed items are ITEM and QUANTITY.
The user wants to increase the apples quantity by 2. So, the SQL statement should target the FRUITS table, set the QUANTITY to add 2 where ITEM is 'APPLES'. The function requires the SQL_statement parameter, which in this case would be the UPDATE statement.
I need to make sure the syntax is correct. The example given for put_SQL_insert is UPDATE FRUITS SET QUANTITY=4 WHERE ITEM='ORANGE'; so similar structure. Therefore, the correct statement would be UPDATE FRUITS SET QUANTITY = QUANTITY + 2 WHERE ITEM = 'APPLES';. 
I should check if the function allows adding 2 to the quantity. The description says it can perform arithmetic operations, so adding 2 is acceptable. The parameters require Operation, Number_1, Number_2, but here it's a single update, so using the SQL insert function is appropriate.
So the tool call would be to put_SQL_insert with the SQL statement as mentioned. The response from the tool was successful, so I need to inform the user that the action was completed.
</think>
The quantity of apples in the warehouse has been successfully increased by 2. 
If you need further assistance with updating other items or retrieving data, feel free to ask!

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the basic **Little Agent Chatbot** installed first.

### Step 1: Install MariaDB

```bash
# Install MariaDB server and client
sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client

# Secure the installation
sudo mariadb-secure-installation
```

### Step 2: Create Sample Database

```bash
# Connect to MariaDB
mariadb -u root -p -h localhost
```

Then execute the following SQL commands:

```sql
-- Create database and table
CREATE DATABASE MYSTORE;
USE MYSTORE;

CREATE TABLE FRUITS (
    ITEM VARCHAR(50),
    QUANTITY INT
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO FRUITS VALUES 
    ("APPLES", 2),
    ("ORANGE", 3),
    ("APRICOT", 5),
    ("GRAPES", 4),
    ("BANANA", 1);

-- Exit MariaDB
quit;
```

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies & Configure

```bash
# Install MariaDB Python connector
pip install mariadb

# Add database credentials to environment file
echo 'DB_USER=your_maria_db_user' >> .env
echo 'DB_PASSWORD=your_maria_db_password' >> .env
```
